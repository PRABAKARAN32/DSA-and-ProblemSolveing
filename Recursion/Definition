Recursion:
   The function That Call itself until the base condition (or) the termination condition occur .

The five Condition used to solve the Problem using Recursion are,
  1) Understand the Problem
  2) Identify the SubProblem
  3) Trust/Faith
  4) Link the Problem and SubProblem
  5) Base Condition

Recursion VS Iteration
   * Things done by recursively can also be done by iteratively.
   * Iteration does not use the recursive call stack[better space complexity].
   * Recursion has Both
        |---> Ascending Pase
        |---> Descending Pase
   * Recursion has better readability, easy to write (eg: more complex problems)

Ways to write a base case:
   i) Last Valid Input
   ii) First InValid Input
